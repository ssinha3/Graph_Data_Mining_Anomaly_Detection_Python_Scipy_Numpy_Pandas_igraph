Requirements:
============
*Software that needs to be installed (if any) with URLâ€™s to download and instructions to install them.*
Requires Python 2.7 with several libraries: igraph, numpy, and pandas.
The best way to get numpy and pandas is to use Anaconda to install Python: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/.
igraph should be install with the directions here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-igraph.

_Environment variable settings (if any) and OS it should/could run on._
=======================================================================
None.

_Instructions on how to run the program._
=========================================
Program is run from the command line with a single argument: the path to a zipped graph file. Graph file format is in the edge
list structure of the graphs provided in class.
For sample code run

```````````````````````EXAMPLE``````````````````````````
1. unzip the csc-591-Project-Anomaly-Detection.zip
2. cd csc-591-Project-Anomaly-Detection/
3. python Python/netsimile.py "graphs\\"
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_Instructions on how to interpret the results._
===============================================
Program prints all the graph edges, along with the feature matrices
 and finally distance between every pair of graphs.
